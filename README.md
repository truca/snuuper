# Snuuper Test

## Instructions

There are two folders. For both you will need to run:

````
yarn
yarn start
````

Or

````
npm install
npm start
````
(But this one is less cooler)

Start with the _back_ folder and then do it in the _front_ folder. Both need to be running simultaneously so use 2 terminals.
